# Treasure-Map
## About
This Treasure-Map application will find the "treasure" which is the shortest path to the furtherst point given a start location, a base image and a maze image. It will first draw the entire maze on a copy of the base image inside the low order bits. With this encoding, each pixel differsby very little from its original value, which cannot be seen with our eyes. And a decoder is able to draw the shortest path from the start to the furtherst point using a modified BFS algorith. It also provude the option to render the maze on the base image with grey colour.
